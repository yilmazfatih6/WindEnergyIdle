# **TODO**
1. Money System
   - ~~Earn money from turbines per generated energy amount. (For now earn $1 per 1 MW)~~
   - ~~Lock and unlock bottom buttons based on owned money.~~
   - ~~Make bottom button prices increase as they are used. (Use a graph to be able to customize this.)~~
   - ~~Click to speed up turbines~~
   - ~~Change turbine rotation relative to wind map value.~~
   - ~~Implement income upgrade~~
2. Minor Fixes
   - Disable merge button if merge is not possible.
   - Rotate merged turbine.
   - Enable wind map on all grounds
   - Display income on turbines.
   - Add VFX to Turbines
